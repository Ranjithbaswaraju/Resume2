<h3>Acadamic Projects</h3>
<h2>Cost Minimization for Big Data Processing in Geo-Distributed Data Centers</h2>
Objective: Optimize the big data placement, task assignment and data movement such that the overall computation and 
minimize the cost of communication.
● The growing demand for processing big data brings about significant computational, storage, and communication is 
burdens within data centers. As a result, data center providers face substantial operational costs. Therefore, 
minimizing expenses has become a crucial concern upcoming era of big data.
● The proposed model aim optimize the cost. To implement incorporates the utilization of LEACH protocol 
and PSO (particle swarm optimization) algorithm to optimize the cost.
Outcome: The goal is to minimize operational costs and enhance efficiency in big data processing within 
distributed environments. occurs on data placement, data center resizing, and data routing, considering factors like 
task assignment and resource utilization. This optimization aims to improve the overall performance of large-scale 
geo-distributed data centers for big data applications. The technology used is Big Data.
Tools and Technologies Used:
● Technology - Big Data
● Tools - Marckov Chain and Hadoop.
● Software - Anaconda Navigator
